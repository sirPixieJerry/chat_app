## DISCORD CLONE

One of the tasks in the SPICED Academy bootcamp was to build a social media platform in React.js. I was trying to make a chat app according to the model of Discord. Because this is an exercise, there are both Class and Function Components. Among other things, the app uses web sockets (socket.io) and Redux for global states.

Nevertheless, the page needs a complete refactoring to make the code consistent and to increase readability.

A live demo is currently not available.
